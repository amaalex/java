## Problem Description
  - Implement an efficient algorithm (❓) 
  - :heavy_check_mark: that determines, if possible, a subset of words W1,W2,...,Wk (from the ones that you have generated) such that k ≥ 3
  - :heavy_check_mark: and Wi and Wi+1 are neighbors, for all i in [1..k],
  - where Wk+1=W1. (❓)
