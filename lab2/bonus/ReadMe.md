## Problem Description
  
  - :heavy_check_mark: Use the time package in order to describe the start and the end time of the events.
  - ‚ùå: Implement the DSatur graph coloring algorithm.
  - :x: Generate large random instances and:
    - compare the solutions generated by Greedy and DSatur algorithms;
    - analyze the performance of your algorithm (running times, memory consumption). Identify the hot-spots in your code.

## Output
