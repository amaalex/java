# Problem Description

- Create a persistence unit (use EclipseLink or Hibernate or other JPA implementation).
- Verify the presence of the persistence.xml file in your project. Make sure that the driver for EclipseLink or Hibernate was added to to your project classpath (or add it yourself).
- Define the entity classes for your model (at least one) and put them in a dedicated package. You may use the IDE support in order to generate entity classes from database tables.
- Create a singleton responsible with the management of an EntityManagerFactory object.
- Define repository clases for your entities (at least one). They must contain the following methods:
  - create - receives an entity and saves it into the database;
  - findById - returns an entity based on its primary key;
  - findByName - returns a list of entities that match a given name pattern. Use a named query in order to implement this method.
- Test your application.
