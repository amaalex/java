## Problem Description

  - :heavy_check_mark: Each node will contain a Map representing the time costs. Create and print the complete network in the example.
  - :heavy_check_mark: Create a default method in the interface Storage, that is able to return the storage capacity in other units of storage (megabyte, kilobyte, byte).
  - ✔️: In the Network class, create a method to display the nodes that are identifiable, sorted by their addresses.
  - ✔️: Implement an efficient agorithm to determine all the shortests times required for data packets to travel from an identifiable node to another.

## Output
  - 🟢Display the nodes with corresponding neighbors and costs
  - 🟢Display the Identifiable Nodes only
  - 🟢Display the minimum costs between Identifiable nodes
