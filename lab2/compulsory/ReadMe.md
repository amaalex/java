## Problem Description
  An instance of the Room Assignment Problem consists of events and rooms. Events may be courses, labs, seminars, etc. Rooms may be lecture halls, computer labs, etc.

  Each event has a name, a number of participants (its size), a start time and an end time.
  Each room has a name, a type and a capacity.
  
  We consider the problem of assigning a room to each event such that the constraints are satisfied and the number of used rooms is as small as possible (if possible).

  - :heavy_check_mark: Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: Event, Room.
  - :heavy_check_mark: The start and end time will be integers.
  - :heavy_check_mark: The rooms will also have the property type.
  - :heavy_check_mark: The available types will be implemented as an enum.
  - :heavy_check_mark: Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters and setters.
  - :heavy_check_mark: The toString method form the Object class must be properly overridden for all the classes.
  - :heavy_check_mark: Create and print on the screen the objects in the example.
