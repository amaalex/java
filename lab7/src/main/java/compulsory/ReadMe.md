# Problem Description

- ✅ Create an object oriented model of the problem. You may assume that there are 10 tiles for each letter in the alphabet
  and each letter is worth a random number of points (between 1 and 10).
- ✅ Each player will have a name and they must perform in a concurrent manner, extracting repeatedly tokens from the
  board.
- ✅ After each extraction, the player will submit to the board all the letters.
- ✅ Simulate the game using a thread for each player.
- ✅ Pay attention to the synchronization of the threads when extracting tokens from the bag and when putting words on the
  board.

# Output
Simulation running with no error.
Being just a simulation, active word checking and calculating the score were not in scope. These will be done in homework.
