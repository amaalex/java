## Problem Description
  - :heavy_check_mark: Create a class that describes an instance of the problem.
  - :heavy_check_mark: Override the equals method form the Object class for the Event, Room classes. The problem should not allow adding the same event or room twice.
  - :heavy_check_mark: Instead of using an enum, create dedicated classes for lecture halls and computer labs. Room will become abstract. The course room may have an additional property indicating if there is a video projector, and the lab room may indicate the operating system of its computers.
 
  - ❌: Create a class to describe the solution.
  - ❌: Implement a simple algorithm for creating a feasible solution to the problem, "trying" to minimize the number of used rooms.
  - ❌: Write doc comments in your source code and generate the class documentation using javadoc.
