## Problem Description

Positional Game\
\
Consider a game played on a grid-shaped board. A grid is a two-dimensional structure of intersecting lines, the lines are evenly spaced, intersecting at right angles. \
At the beginning of the game, there will be randomly placed small line-shaped tokens (sticks) that connect two adjacent intersections of the grid, along a line of the grid. \
An intersection that is adjacent with at least one stick, is called a node. \
The first player selects any node of the grid and places a circular-shaped token (stone) on it. Next, the players must alternatively choose a new unselected node that is adjacent (is connected by a stick) to the previously selected one and place a stone on it. They use stones of different colors. The player who cannot choose another node, loses the game. \
In order to create a graphical user interface for the game, you may use either Swing or JavaFX.
