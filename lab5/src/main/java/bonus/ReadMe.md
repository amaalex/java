## Problem Description

- Suppose there is an official set of concepts (keywords) C, and that each item has a list of such concepts (example of such a classification system). Evolve your model in order to support this new feature.
- Write an algorithm that determines:
  - the largest set of pairs (item, concept) such that all items and all concepts in this set are distinct.
  - the smallest set of pairs (item, concept) such that all items and all concepts are present in at least one pair.
- Create large instances of the problem and test your algorithm.
